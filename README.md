#### Lab Assignment 7:
This assignment was when I was first learning how to create my own functions, to easily make multiple of the same intricate shape over and over again. I decided to base my project off of one of the alien ships from _Space Invaders_. My main goal was to kind of make an arcade cabinet.


#### Lab Assignment 8:
To run this assignment, a server will be required. This assignment was my first introduction into loading images into my projects. I used some kind of silly pictures in the project, but it made it a fun project to work on. Also shown in the project is some text and one of the pictures changing sizes and location based on the mouse input.


#### Lab Assignment 10:
This assignment was my introduction to the many extended libraries of p5.js. I chose to use an extended shapes library called **p5.shape.js**; this library added multiple new and easy to use shape presets to the p5.js code. I chose this one because making intricate shapes in p5.js can be annoying at times, and this really sped up the process. I used these new shapes to make a figure sitting on a bus stop bench, along with a road and the bench itself. Most of the shapes used in the project were from the expanded library.
